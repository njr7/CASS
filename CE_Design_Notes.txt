CLASS Editor Design Notes:

-How to handle flow import?
1.) Plan basic XML
2.) Prepare database to receive XML
3.) Create way to export and then read XML, to then populate flow automatically

-How to handle adding an infinite amount of potential steps?
multiple pages (recursive?)
or
javascript to manipulate one page (better option, possibly more work)





Current Goal:
-Implement the form for the first required step (creating a problem), insert submitted data into XML, insert XML into the database. Then be able to take the XML from the database, de-construct it, and use the data to rebuild the step.
